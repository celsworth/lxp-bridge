# Inputs

This document details the hash structure of "inputs" messages sent out by lxp-bridge. These correspond with transient read-only input registers on the inverter.

The inverter sends these across 3 packets, which are directly mapped into JSON and published in `lxp/{datalog}/inputs/1`, `../2` and `../3`. From lxp-bridge v0.6.0, there is also an `../all` message which combines all three into a single hash of data.

Eventually (not before lxp-bridge v1.0) the individual messages may be removed in favour of the new `all` message. Please prefer use of the `all` message in favour of the 1/2/3 messages in new projects.

If InfluxDB is enabled, these values are sent as a single unified hash which matches the `all` MQTT message.

Example structures are shown below with inline comments.
