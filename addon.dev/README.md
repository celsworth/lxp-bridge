## About

lxp-bridge is a tool to communicate with a LuxPower inverter (commonly used with home-battery and solar setups), written in Rust.

It allows you to monitor and control your inverter locally without any dependence on the manufacturer's own servers in China.

Full documentation can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/celsworth/lxp-bridge/wiki).
